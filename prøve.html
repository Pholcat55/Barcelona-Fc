<h1><strong style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Camp nou</h1></strong>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<h3>Building of Camp Nou</h3>
<p style="text-align: start;">Camp Nou took over from FC Barcelona's former stadium, Camp de Les Corts, in 1957. A proposal for a new stadium had already been made<br> in 1948, but it wasn't until Hungarian star Ladislao Kubala joined the club that people started talking about Barça had grown from the <br>  Camp de Les Corts. Camp de Les Corts was completed in 1922, and after <br> several major developments, a total of 60,000 spectators were squeezed in, a number that was seen as unjustified to exceed.

   It was therefore <br> decided at the board meeting on 19 September 1950 that a new plot of land should be purchased for development. A plot of <br> land next to Maternitat was acquired, close to the old Les Corts stadium. However, it did not go as planned. Just over six months later, several <br> of the members of the commission responsible for planning the new stadium began to change their minds about the choice of location. <br> Instead of Maternitat, there was a desire for a property on Diagonal.
   
   This led to the project being put on hold until Francesc Miró-Sans won <br> the presidential election in 1953. The new stadium became his most <br> important cause, and in February 1954 it was decided to build on the original property at Maternitat and not at Diagonal. On 28 March 1954, <br> in front of 60,000 fans, Miró-Sans laid the first brick of the new Camp Nou stadium.
   
   The responsibility for the design of the new stadium <br> was placed in the hands of the architects Francesc Mitjans Miró (Miró-Sans' cousin), Josep <br> Soteras Mauri and Lorenzo García Barbón. Just over a year later, the contract for the construction itself was given to INGAR SA, <br> which was to take 66.6 million pesetas for a job of 18 months.
   
   As with many other large construction projects, the budget was also exceeded <br> here. When the construction was finished, a sum of approximately 288 <br> million pesetas was calculated, which the club had to finance with loans of over 160 million pesetas. The stadium was financed, but <br> with the purchase you got a debt that you were forced to pay for several years afterwards. </p>
<h3>
   Opening
</h3>
<p>
   The date for the inauguration of the Camp Nou was set for 24 September 1957 and a committee led by Aleix Buxeres <br>
    and Nicolau Casaus was given the job of organizing a special opening ceremony. On 21 September, the inauguration was <br>
     opened with José Maria de Cossío, a member of the Real Academia Española, reading the proclamation that officially opened <br>
      the celebrations of the inauguration of the Camp Nou. During this September week, several of the club's representatives <br>
       participated in international sports conferences in Les Corts and Palau Municipal d'Esports. These meetings inspired the poet <br>
        Josep M. de Sagarra to write a sonnet called Blau Grana, and Josep Badia and Adolf Cabané to write FC Barcelona's anthem.

<br> On the day of the Mercè festival in 1957, 
 the whole city of Barcelona was dressed in the club's colours. The opening ceremony started <br>
 with Camp Nou being blessed by the Archbishop of Barcelona, Gregorio Modrego, and then Handel's Hallelujah was sung by the Gracienc <br> 
 choir. 
  The doors were then opened to more than 100,100 visitors. At half past four, the tradition of singing the national anthem began before <br>
  the 
   inaugural match between FC Barcelona and Legia Warsaw could begin. The starting lineup for Barça was Ramallets, <br> Olivella, Brugué, 
   Segarra, <br>
    Vergés, Gensana, Basora, Villaverde, Martínez, Kubala and Tejada, while the second half was played by Ramallets, <br>
     Segarra, Brugué,
     Gràcia, <br>
     Flotats, Bosch, Hermes, Ribelles, Tejada, Sampedro and Evaristo. The match ended 4-2 after goals from Eulogio Martínez (who in the 11th <br>
      minute scored the very first goal at Camp Nou), Tejada, Sampedro and Evaristo. During the break, you could see a dance show by 1,500 <br>
       members from Agrupació Cultural Folklòrica de Barcelona where 10,000 pigeons were released into the air.
